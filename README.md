# Ethical Considerations
In developing this data visualization project, we were committed to upholding the highest ethical standards. We prioritized transparency by using publically available datasets provided by the World Bank, clearly documenting our methodologies, and any assumptions made during analysis. We recognize the potential impact of our work and remain dedicated to promoting responsible data usage, fostering trust, and encouraging informed decision-making.  We were also mindful of any potential biases that could have been introduced choosing metrics and comparing data for various countries.  We endeavored to conduct additional research and review in order to maintain as much objectivity and representation as possible.

# Acknowledgments
Machine_Learning_Project was created as an assignment for the University of California, Irvine Data Analytics Bootcamp - June 2024 Cohort under the instruction and guidance of Melissa Ingle (Instructor) and Mitchell Stone (TA). The practical exercises and coding examples demonstrated through the bootcamp helped inform and inspire the code for this project.
