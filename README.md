# Project 4: Machine Learning and Predicting Obesity

# Overview
Obesity has been a rising health concern among most modern populations for the last few decades. There are numerous health risks, both  immediate and long-term, that can have detrimental consequences to the longevity and quality of life for an individual. Such consequential impacts include but are not limited to: respiratory difficulties, increased risk of fractures, hypertension, diseases of the gallbladder and pancreas, increased mental health issues, increased risk of non-communicable diseases, and more. As such, it is important for policymakers and the general public to understand not just the impact of obesity, but the leading causes that contribute significantly to obesity rates. Our goal for this project is to further understand and visualize the leading contributors to growing obesity rates in populations such as Colombia, Peru and Mexico, and develop a machine learning model that can support health initiatives to manage overweight and obesity by predicting obesity levels based on lifestyle parameters.

## Data Source & Database Selection
For our analysis, we primarily used the dataset gathered and compiled by Fabio Mendoza Palechor and Alexis de la Hoz Manotas with the technical assistance provided by the Universidad de la Costa (CUC). The dataset was used in relation to Palechor and Manotas' academic article "Dataset for estimation of obesity levels based on eating habits and physical condition in individuals from Colombia, Peru and Mexico", published in August 2019. We chose this dataset specifically because the information gathered correlates strongly with the data needed to develop our machine learning model for predicting obesity. 

Furthermore, this paper contains data regarding eating habits and physical conditions of individuals ages 14 and 61, using a web platform with a survey where anonymous users answered each question, to which the information was processed obtaining 17 attributes and 2111 records, after utilizing a balancing process known as SMOTE. The attributes identified with eating habits are: Frequent consumption of high caloric food (FAVC), Frequency of consumption of vegetables (FCVC), Number of main meals (NCP), Consumption of food between meals (CAEC), Consumption of water daily (CH20), and Consumption of alcohol (CALC). The attributes related with the physical condition are: Calories consumption monitoring (SCC), Physical activity frequency (FAF), Time using technology devices (TUE), Transportation used (MTRANS), other variables obtained were: Gender, Age, Height and Weight.

# Ethical Considerations
In developing this data visualization project, we were committed to upholding the highest ethical standards. We prioritized transparency by using publically available datasets provided by the World Bank, clearly documenting our methodologies, and any assumptions made during analysis. We recognize the potential impact of our work and remain dedicated to promoting responsible data usage, fostering trust, and encouraging informed decision-making.  We were also mindful of any potential biases that could have been introduced choosing metrics and comparing data for various countries.  We endeavored to conduct additional research and review in order to maintain as much objectivity and representation as possible.

# Acknowledgments
Machine_Learning_Project was created as an assignment for the University of California, Irvine Data Analytics Bootcamp - June 2024 Cohort under the instruction and guidance of Melissa Ingle (Instructor) and Mitchell Stone (TA). The practical exercises and coding examples demonstrated through the bootcamp helped inform and inspire the code for this project.
